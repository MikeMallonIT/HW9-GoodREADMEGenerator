# Homework 9 - Good README Generator - Michael Mallon

## What I did

This week's homework assignment was my first attempt at server-side JavaScript (NodeJS). I used the File Systems and Inquirer packages to ask users questions via terminal and save them to a markdown file via File Systems


<br>

### Motivation:
Given this was my first go at server-side programming, I knew it would be an important building block for future development. FS and Inquirer are two basic packages that I'm sure I will see again. This application made me think of differnt ways something similar could be used for non user-facing server maintenance

<br>

### Problems I solved:
    * Figured out how to build server application and call it in terminal
    * Learned how to use basic Node.js packages
    * Used template literals to build md file

<br />
<br />

## Installation:
Download all associated files in this repository including the index.html file and all files in the assets folder. Install Node.js then use the `npm install` function. After that, CD to the directory the root application folder is installed in and use the `node index.js` function.

## Usage:
